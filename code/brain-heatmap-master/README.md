In exampleMain.m you will find an example on how to use the script (from matlab).
You can use this script and fit it to your needs.
* Matlab will generate a csv file which holds the region ID and the desired color of the region in hex.


Then run the python (tested on python2.7) script to generate the heatmaps.
* The python script will load the colors from the csv file. 
* Then it will modify the atlas svg-images and save the new images to the output folder.


If you enconter problems while running the python script try install beautiful soup
