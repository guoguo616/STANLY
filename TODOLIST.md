# Things to work on for future releases
- add function for statistics
- updates needed to `chooseTemplate`
  - in gui could try to implement a selection tool to select desired alignment region
- ability to run correlation analysis between selected regions
- option to choose merfish image being aligned, i.e. dapi/polyT/diff z-slice
- output data for all samples under X condition, i.e. in a region or within same cell as another gene
- add sagittal functionality to template alignment
  - this should likely be incorporated into a larger concept of how we maintain 3D space even while working with 2D images
