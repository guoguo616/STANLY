# Things to work on for future releases
- add function for statistics
- ability to run correlation analysis between selected regions
- option to choose merfish image being aligned, i.e. dapi/polyT/diff z-slice
- output data for all samples under X condition, i.e. in a region or within same cell as another gene
- add sagittal functionality to template alignment
  - this should likely be incorporated into a larger concept of how we maintain 3D space even while working with 2D images
- add ability to change registration options using json or other sort of file
  - should allow user to change any options offered by ants.registration
- normalize the `importVisiumData` and `importMerfishData` to make sure of equivalence of output
- change dictionaries to specify what `tissueRegistered` is registered to, whether `template` or `sample`
- look over interdependent functions, i.e. `process*Data` including `loadProcessed*Data`
  - this would likely just be a matter of making sure the output of different `process*Data` is unified
  - `applyAntsTransformations` 
- update functions to use AntsPyX version of `apply_transforms_to_points` rather than using system call
- fix transformation identification within the `runANTsInterSampleRegistration`
- should update language of `transformedTissuePositionList` to `registeredTissuePositionList`
- update (or create secondary function) `applyAntsTransformations` to be `applyAntsToAllenTransformations`
